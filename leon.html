			Leon is now 46 weeks old and refuses to let anybody wipe his nose!
		<br>
		<br>
			This week we discovered a new (to us) playground within walking distance. Tip: if you want your playground to stay underground, call it a <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/andrews-grove">grove</a> instead!
		<br>
		<br>	
			And if you're looking for somebody who can clap, wave, and stretch, <a href="leon_46_movie.html">here's your guy</a> (25-second video with sound, which gets louder near the end, sorry)!

                        Leon has also started calling Marcella "mam". His precision and recall are both pretty good!

                <br>
                	<i>This is a guest post by The Other Parent!</i>
                <p>
                        Leon is 43 weeks old and can now amuse himself by repeatedly rolling a ball and chasing after it!
                </p>
                <p>
                        Leon was escorted to two new libraries this weekend by his Yiayia and Papou, bringing his lifetime total to four libraries! We quiver under the great expectation of continuing this exponential trend.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Yiayia and Pappou also brought a small collection of vintage baby Christmas outfits from Leon's uncle and Papou! Leon's velvet-swaddled figure is sure to bring holiday cheer to all who encounter his squawking form.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Leon continues his foray into language acquisition by chanting <i>dadada! dat!</i> at any masculine figure in his presence (and also toys, furniture, and bits of French toast).

                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon is 42 weeks old and can drink unassisted from a cup, sometimes!
                <br>
                <br>
                        And, per today's pediatrician visit, his hemoglobin levels are solidly in the middle of the WHO recommended range!
               
                <br>
                        Beyond that, we increasingly measure Leon's maturation by convoluted and highly contextual changes in behavior that require long and, by the time they are done, kind of embarrassing explanations. For example, one of his toys is a <a href="https://moonkieshop.com/cdn/shop/files/ufo_silicone_pulling_toy_ocean.jpg?v=1723017182&width=798">tentacled alien spacecraft</a> that has a hollow disc punctuated with holes, through which one can poke a finger and move a button from one hole to the next, which requires pushing the button down and shifting it over and finally popping it up in the next hole, and once he could only push, but now he can shift and pop.
                <br>
                <br>
                        But developing a shared and mysterious context is at least a partial definition of family, so that's probably fine!

                <br>
			Leon is 41 weeks old and has somewhere between five and seven teeth!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Yesterday was Leon's first Thanksgiving. He ate mashed potatoes and pumpkin puree and, understandably, got so excited he skipped his afternoon nap.
                <br>
                <br>
                        After weeks of repeated prompting, Leon can somewhat reliably address me as "dud". Aggressive self-promotion: sometimes, it works!

                <br>
                        Leon is 40 weeks old and has now spent more time outside of the womb than in it!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Matthew's parents and Marcella's brother visited this week! Leon received them with the measured beneficence of a monarch.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon's new record for circumambulating our living room coffee table is six consecutive times (cruising). Counter-clockwise!

                <br>

                        Leon is one day shy of 9 months old and can high five you whenever you want!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon's newest pasttime is crawling up to a small cabinet, pulling up to standing, taking a tissue out of a tissue box on top, and tearing it into pieces. His record is 17!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, Leon is also strong enough to break a crayon that is <a href="https://shop.crayola.com/color-and-draw/crayola-jumbo-crayons-16-ct.-5203900001.html">conspicuously advertised</a> as "hard to break". Maybe if he breaks enough crayons we can melt the fragments down and make a Frankencrayon! Oh, excuse me, Frankencrayon's <i>monster</i>.

                        LEON IS 38 WEEKS OLD AND CAN NOW CRUISE (I.E., WALK WITH HIS HANDS ON SOMETHING) AROUND CORNERS. MAYBE THERE'S STILL TIME LEFT IN THE SEASON TO FIND HIM A CORN MAZE!
                <br>
                <br>
                        I'M SORRY, WHAT? OH, AM I YELLING? SORRY, LEON DISCOVERED NEW VOLUMES OF EXCITED SCREAMING THIS WEEK, AND I MIGHT BE MISCALIBRATED NOW.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Anyway, Leon has also been practicing getting back down on the ground from a cruising position. It's getting more consistent!

                <br>
                        Leon is 37 weeks old and, per his finger prick test this morning, has very little lead in his bloodstream!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Our family Halloween costume appears in the second photo above. Marcella's mom and sister made Leon's costume, and Marcella made ours. If you're not sure what it is, rack your brain for fiction's greatest wearer of damaged overalls. If you're still not sure, maybe <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/Corduroy_book_cover.jpg">this</a> will help.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon's newest favorite activity is throwing things on the ground. I haven't seen it mentioned in any of his emotion-naming baby books, but I've been around long enough to know disdain when I see it.

                <br>
                        This week Leon visited a local lighting manufacturer's warehouse as part of <a href="https://ohny.org/weekend/">Open House New York Weekend</a> (see second photo above). Lighting manufacture requires many components!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon's bespoke Halloween costume has arrived. Stay tuned.

			Leon is eight months old! That's old enough to pick up a Cheerio and pop it into his mouth, but not old enough to keep it from falling out right afterward.
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week, Leon has experimented with sitting down from standing, crawling backward, and d- and b- sounds. Yesterday he spent a solid minute repeating the word "duh". We were duly chastened.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon has also been having a lot of fun with his new nanny. She took half of these pictures!

                        Leon is 34 weeks old and heavy enough that, if you're just lying on the ground minding your own business and, as is his wont, he decides to crawl on top of you and stand up, it hurts! So much heft over such little feet; physics is merciless.

                <br>

			Leon is 33 weeks old and weighs almost as much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_condor">California condor</a>, a bird so, uh, <a href="https://raptor.umn.edu/sites/raptor.umn.edu/files/2020-03/California%20condor.jpg">specific-looking</a>, that  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/The_Naturalist%27s_Miscellany_Vol_9_Pl_301_California_condor.jpg">this</a> counts as a flattering likeness.
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week Leon ate some eggs! After each bite, he looked at us with mild accusation in his eyes, but maybe he'll come around.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon has also learned how to clap! It is an artful and subtle clap, characterized less by the sound it makes than the sound it doesn't. Or something. Nonetheless, we emphasize: it is technically clapping.

                <br>
                        Leon is 32 weeks old and hardly ever gets weighed these days! However, if an animal comparison is desired, he now has about as many teeth as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narwhal">narwhal</a> (rounding up).
                <br>
                <br>
                        Marcella's parents came back to town this week! They did a lot of babysitting and home improvement.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon now eats at least a tablespoon of solid food per day! Applesauce, sweet potatoes, zucchini, oatmeal, peanut butter, yogurt, water out of a cup -- he and his palate are expanding apace.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, joyous <a href="img/leon/32_pumpkin.png">autumn wishes</a> from the man himself.

			Leon is seven months old and a little heavier than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_vulture">Cape vulture</a>! The Cape vulture looks to me like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Cape_vulture_at_De_Wildt_Cheetah_Research_Centre_%28South_Africa%29.jpg/1920px-Cape_vulture_at_De_Wildt_Cheetah_Research_Centre_%28South_Africa%29.jpg">a stone wearing an unconvincing bird disguise</a> and, like Leon, will really <a href="https://www.biodiversityexplorer.info/birds/accipitridae/images/article-1280155-09AAC_658w.jpg">grab your face</a> if you aren't careful.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon now crawls almost everywhere almost all the time. Up, down, around, over, through. Pick your favorite preposition and Leon has probably demonstrated it this week.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon has also developed a new and intense fascination with peeking under rugs (see photo above). To the best of our knowledge, he hasn't found anything, but a thorough investigation is ongoing.

                <br>
                        Today Leon is 30 weeks old and weighs about as much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattled_crane">wattled crane</a>. Even we must concede that, unlike the wattled crane, Leon does not at the moment possess the "appearance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracility">gracility</a>".
                <br>
                <br>
                        Perhaps not coincidentally, this week Leon ate a lot of peanut butter!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon is also starting to pull from sitting to standing. If you put on the right music, he might even <a href="leon_30_movie.html">dance with you</a> (12-second video).

                <br>
                        Today Leon is 29 weeks old and tips the scales at approximately one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kori_bustard">Kori bustard</a>. Like the Kori bustard, Leon is "watchful" and "avoids flying if possible".
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week Leon dropped down to two daily naps. Consequently, he is now awake for three hour stretches that accommodate longer trips. We even saw (a humble bit of what is nonetheless technically) the ocean!
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week Leon also participated in his first experiment (see first photo). He sat down in a highly controlled room, chose which shapes to look at, and was paid for his time. It's a long way from his old <a href="leon_16_movie.html">jackhammering days</a>.

                        Leon is 28 weeks old and was once more not weighed today! We forgot again. Or, his bulk is one of those majesties of nature that measurement would only cheapen.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Matthew's parents returned to Dallas this week. Having them and their several hundred hours of free childcare here for three months was a gift for all of us.
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week Leon learned that he can sleep on his stomach! He also learned that crawling over to our side of the crib makes yelling at us at 5 AM more effective.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, Leon tried avocado today! It now makes up the majority of his lifetime solid food consumption. Small sample sizes are like that.

                        Leon is 27 weeks old and was not weighed today. It slipped our minds! We may be growing to think of him more and more as a person, and less and less as a prize-winning pumpkin.
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week Leon started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbling#Timeline_of_typical_vocal_development">canonical babbling</a>! Everything he says is now canon!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, much like the protagonist of The Contours' 1962 hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_You_Love_Me">"Do You Love Me"</a>, Leon can now <a href="leon_27_movie.html">mashed potato</a> (30-second movie).

		It's Leon's half birthday! He weighs a bit over half as much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_penguin">king penguin</a>. Both Leon and the king penguin enjoy displaying <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/SGI-2016-South_Georgia_%28Fortuna_Bay%29%E2%80%93King_penguin_%28Aptenodytes_patagonicus%29_04.jpg">tremendous expanses of stomach</a>.

                <br>
                        This week Leon slept through his first complete crib nap! We also woke one morning to find him on his hands and knees in his crib, staring straight at us and watching us sleep, with the attentive and self-effacing demeanor of any good anthropologist.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon also met his first fellow baby! He almost immediately burst into tears, like any good but perhaps overstimulated anthropologist.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, did you know that the point of reading books is to turn the pages as fast as possible? The text is just there if you get tired and need something to look at while you rest. We didn't know it, but Leon does.

                        Leon is now 25 weeks old and about as heavy as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller%27s_sea_eagle">Steller's sea eagle</a>, a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Haliaeetus_pelagicus_%28Rausu%2C_Japan%29.jpg">bird</a> that strongly reminds me of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/CAT_420F_IT_-_Arlington%2C_MA.jpg/2560px-CAT_420F_IT_-_Arlington%2C_MA.jpg">construction equipment</a>.

                <br>
                        This week Leon ate his first solid food: a small piece of basil. The word "ate" is somewhat generous. It may be more accurate to say that a small piece of basil entered his mouth and remains unaccounted for.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon has also gotten better at hanging out in his crib. Not napping, but hanging out, and sometimes babbling to himself, with the opaque frankness of people speaking a language that they know nobody nearby understands.

                <br>
			Leon is 24 weeks old and was not weighed today! Since this weight estimate is fiction, I'd say he weighs more than <a href="https://over-the-garden-wall.fandom.com/wiki/Beatrice">Beatrice</a> but less than <a href="https://nedroid.com/?509">Reginald</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon is continuing to experiment with crib naps. He can do it, but maybe not yet. We have once more taken up the heavy yoke of baby cuddling.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, Leon had his first experiences with solid food! He disdained some zucchini, put his in hand in someone else's birthday cake, and <a href="leon_24_movie.html">almost ate some carrot</a> (30-second movie).

                        Leon is 23 weeks old and weighs about as much as 15 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufescent_imperial_pigeon">rufescent imperial pigeons</a>! Rufescent means "tinged with red". A <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=rufescent&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3">probably typical</a> usage is "<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Charles_Robert_Leslie_%281794-1859%29_-_Queen_Victoria_Receiving_the_Sacrament_at_her_Coronation%2C_28_June_1838_-_RCIN_406993_-_Royal_Collection.jpg">Queen Victoria's coronation</a> was more than just rufescent." Unlike Leon, the rufescent imperial pigeon "does not vocally express itself frequently".
                <br>
                <br>
                        Buoyed by his sleepy nights, and quaking under his growing heft, we have started transitioning Leon's naps to his crib. He can do it!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon has also become unignorably interested in food. At meals he watches the trajectories of spoons with the rapt and shuttling attention of a tennis spectator, and the time for simple spectation has perhaps ended. Watch this space!

                        Leon is now 22 weeks (and five calendar months) old and outweighs the average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_griffon_vulture">Eurasian griffon vulture</a>, a bird that <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Gyps_fulvus_in_flight_-_Spain.jpg/1920px-Gyps_fulvus_in_flight_-_Spain.jpg">looks like it it alights only to dispense the wisdom of countless sun-bleached ages</a>. Like the Eurasian griffon vulture, Leon has a "buff body".

                <br>
                        Leon has now put together four consecutive nights of falling asleep without crying! There is a Facebook group devoted to baby sleep schedules, Marcella asked the moderators for advice, we followed their advice, and a great peace has reigned ever since. The internet: sometimes, it works!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon can now sit unassisted for several apparently uneffortful minutes and has the drool-covered feet to prove it. He can also scoot himself backward farther than his parents expected or he desired (see second photo above), but sometimes he goes <a href="leon_22_movie.html">forward</a>, too (9-second movie, with kind of loud sound).

Rüppell's vulture has been recorded flying at 37,000 feet above sea level, suggesting that, like Leon, sometimes it just does stuff because it can.
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week Leon reconsidered his relationship with sleeping through the night. As his most trusted advisors, we have counseled further reconsideration.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon has also kind of started crawling. Crawling is the wrong word. "Butterfly stroke, but on land" is closer, but maybe less elegant. Maybe less elegance is appropriate.

		Leon is 20 weeks old and about as heavy as one tenth of a <a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Bird">1978 Big Bird</a>. In related news, yesterday we found <a href="img/leon/20_sesame_1.png">this</a> in a local take a book/leave a book. Based on my reading, <a href="img/leon/20_sesame_2.png">grabbing it was good</a>.

		Several cute Leon photos appear above. For a fully realistic experience, please imagine several minutes of Leon blowing high-drool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_a_raspberry">raspberries</a> while viewing them. Hear it; visualize it; feel the fine mist on your face. If you have opted out of the fully realistic experience, we do not share your choice, but we do understand.

                        Leon is 19 weeks old and a little heavier than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Indian_bustard">great Indian bustard</a>! The great Indian bustard is ''among the heaviest of the flying birds'' and, unlike Leon, seems to have only one <a href="img/leon/19_bustard.png">flattering angle</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                        When presented with two objects, Leon can now grab both of them simultaneously. However, he has yet to perfect a similar sense of how many things can go in his mouth simultaneously.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon is also increasingly interested in food. If we eat in front of him, he watches carefully. If we brush our teeth in front of him, he watches and, presumably, pities us for twice a day trying and failing to eat our toothbrushes.
                <br>

                        Leon is now 18 weeks (and four calendar months) old and about as heavy as five hundred <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_pygmy_kingfisher">African pygmy kingfishers</a>. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/023_African_pygmy_kingfisher_at_Kibale_forest_National_Park_Photo_by_Giles_Laurent.jpg">Birds are crazy</a>!

                        This week Leon took his first subway ride. It was a calm round trip, except for maybe twenty seconds of whimpering. But that's pretty good for anybody's first time on the subway.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Leon's dexterity continues to grow. This week he started passing objects between his hands. He can also turn his wrist to look at an object from different angles. He's also started opening his mouth really wide. We await his combination of these developments with an increasingly familiar mix of trepidation and excitement.

                        Yesterday was Leon's four-month pediatrician visit. In the honeyed words of his post-visit medical notes, he is "without abnormal findings"!
                <br>
                <br>
                        This week Leon tried several new things. He tried putting his thumb in his mouth, with a specialization in putting it in so far that it made him mad (first image above); he tried turning the cardboard pages of one of his books; and he tried idol worshop (third image above).
                <br>
                <br>
                        But we're most tickled that he tried <a href="leon_17_movie.html">laughing</a> (2 second video).

                        Leon is sixteen weeks old and weighs somewhere in the ballpark of sixty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_kestrel">American kestrels</a>! Like the American kestrel, Leon is "not actually a kestrel in the phylogenetic sense".

                        "Leon has started falling asleep by himself in his crib" is what I would write if past experience had not strongly suggested that writing about sleep victories on this blog is the surest path to reversing them. I am therefore only discussing that sentence as a thought experiment.

                <br>

                	Leon has also upped his babbling. Every day he directs long and melismatic "ohs" at a seemingly nondescript corner of the ceiling. Lucky corner!

		<br>
		<br>
			Leon learned to make a new face this week. See any of the photos above for details.
		<br>
		<br>
			He has also built enough neck strength to sit facing out in a carrier. Now he can watch the world go by on walks. Judging by the <a href="img/leon/13_marcella.png">drool</a>, he thinks the world looks delicious.
		<br>

			Leon is now twelve weeks old and exerts the same gravitational pull as approximately one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_albatross">Amsterdam albatross</a>. Unlike the Amsterdam albatross, Leon's "feeding ecology and at-sea distribution" is well understood.
		<br>
		<br>	
			Leon is steadily acquiring greater awareness and control of his limbs. If you need somebody to bat at a nearby rattle or stomp happily on the solar plexus of whoever is holding him, we know just the guy.
		<br>
		<br>
			Leon has also reached new heights of hand-chewing. If he remembers his hands exist, it's probably only a matter of time until he's got one in his mouth and is making the sort of noises typically reserved for cartoon characters messily eating giant cartoon turkey legs.

			We've spent a few months reading our own books aloud. This week we switched to Leon's. He pays attention (see photo).

			<br>
			Leon is becoming grabbier and grabbier. He'll grab a toy, your clothes, his face, your face (see photos), whatever. He grabs voraciously and without prejudice. I am writing this while somebody else holds him, lest I be grabbed, too.
			<br>
			<br>
			Finally, Leon is getting better at sleeping. His longest stretch of night sleep now averages about five hours. It may not be obvious to all readers, but that is a very happy ending to this post.

			This week Leon discovered his ears. Ears are an important component of the auditory system, but if you are Leon, they also double as convenient objects to spend intensely focused minutes at a time grabbing and twisting and folding and unfolding like they're puzzles to be solved.
			<br>
			<br>
			We're also walking more. One was a two-mile round trip to get dumplings, to enjoy with our little dumpling. Another was a one-mile round trip to get little cookies, to enjoy with our little cookie. Another was a one-mile round trip to get a tub of protein powder, to enjoy with our little tub, and so on. This sentence construction works for a surprising variety of objects.

		<br>
		<br>
		Leon's favorite new activity is unclenching his fists. It's nice to have a less intimidating baby. We even felt confident enough to have some friends over for dinner. But open hands means he spends more time tiny-fingered tickling the neck and ribcage of the person holding him. Life is full of tradeoffs.
		<br>
		<br>
		We had a few nights this week where Leon couldn't sleep in his bassinet for more than thirty minutes straight. Then a sleep consultant suggested that we keep him upright for a while after feeding for the sake of gravity-aided digestion. Then he went back to sleeping normally. The logic of infancy is opaque and remorseless but, typically, sound.

		Last night, Leon hit another milestone: his brain is now developed enough to feel nostalgia! It's the best possible explanation for why he suddenly decided to have his shortest-sleeping night since leaving the hospital. We congratulate Leon on his deepening emotional complexity.
		<br>
		<br>
		Other things that have grown: his range of facial expressions, the fraction of the bassinet he occupies, and the amount of time we spend daydreaming about where we'll take him once his immune system is developed enough to go out into the world for real.

		<br>
		<br>
		A neutral observer might struggle to identify significant Leon developments since last week's post. Luckily, we are not neutral observers, so we can honestly claim that Leon's smiles are becoming slightly less random, his vocalizations are acquiring the tenor of conversation, and he is <i>this close</i> to rolling over. Plus, one incontrovertible fact: he is a <a href="leon_5_movie.html">natural dancer</a> (five-second video).
		<br>
		<br>
		There was a night this week where Leon put together five consecutive hours of uninterrupted sleep. We woke up and discussed it like it was a gleaming alien spacecraft that had alighted overnight in our backyard and now lay silently under a thin sheet of dew. We whispered to each other in awe, curiosity, and a little fear, then agreed it was just a lucky break, then silently and irrationally constructed private fantasies of a baby that starts sleeping through the night after one month. It hasn't happened again, but we still dream.

		Marcella's parents are now back in Minnesota. That means we've had a few days as a trio. Things are getting figured out, and then changing, and then getting figured out again. A consequence of fractured sleep is the sense of one endless day, but the day is so different from the ones before that we can't really be mad about it.

 		Some milestones: first bath (with poured water); first pie (visual inspection only); now frequently grabs the shirt of whoever is holding him (with somewhat disturbing strength, the effect of which is often compounded by continuous and dispassionate eye contact).

		Leon is now three weeks old! There's no pediatrician visit for this milestone. However,  we did buy what the internet claims is an accurate scale, so we can report that according to the <a href="https://opentraits.org/datasets/avonet.html">AVONET database of birds</a>, Leon probably weighs a bit more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_adjutant">lesser adjutant</a> and a bit less than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy_eagle">harpy eagle</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Things continue to be pretty good. Leon has gotten better, maybe too much better, at being awake, so we've upped the number of contact naps and discovered that the emergency radio Marcella received from a WQXR pledge drive, when tuned to an empty band, produces quality white noise.
		<br>
		<br>
		Marcella's parents head back to Minnesota next week, so the two of us took advantage of the presence of babysitters with a genetic investment in Leon's well-being and had dinner at <a href="https://fulgurances.com/en/the-restaurants/fulgurances-laundromat/">our favorite special occasion restaurant</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Leon also had his first stroller walk this week. Seeing Leon in the context of the world, and not the context of our home, is strange, but probably inevitable, given how children work.

		<br>
		Today was Leon's two-week pediatrician appointment. He continues to be, medically speaking, a big ol' baby. The half-mile round trip was our first walk as a family (baby wraps are cool; I'm wearing Leon right now).
		<br>
		<br>
Leon is an enthusiastic participant in all of the human bodily functions. He sometimes reminds us of somebody who, having been placed in the cockpit of an airplane for the first time, decides to press every single button at once.
		<br>
		<br>
		Matthew's parents visited this week. Having them here has been fun. Finding place for six adults and one baby in a 600 square foot apartment has been fun, too. Last night the grandparents kicked us out, so the two of us had a surprisingly relaxed dinner at the restaurant across the street.
		<br>
		<br>
		We're slowly becoming less and less anxious as Leon patiently presents us with evidence that he's not as fragile as we think. We're also averaging 6-7 hours of sleep per 24 hours, though frankly, I hesitate to even write this fact down, since given what people had told us about newborns, that number seems like a random and unearned gift.
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally, here is a (somewhat old) 9-second video of Leon <a href="leon_2_movie.html">making noises in his sleep</a>.

		<a href="img/leon/1.png">Photo</a> of the week!
		<br>
		<br>
		Leon is now over a week old!  He has regained most of his birth weight and is feeding well. Marcella’s parents are nearby for a few weeks, and their help — especially the evening period when they take Leon into the living room and we put on earplugs and eye masks and make a deposit in the sleep bank — is appreciated. 
		<br>
		<br>
		So far, life feels kind of like it’s shrunk to a space about the size of our apartment. Sometimes that space just seems to be feeding and diapering and figuring out who is less dangerously close to falling asleep. But sometimes we’re staring at Leon and don’t know why we’d bother doing anything else. Overall, pretty good!
