			Hi, this is a website that we plan to update periodically as a centralized way to publish exciting Leon news. Read at your leisure, but please don't share this link.
		<br>
		<br>
			If you want to receive an email whenever we update this website, fill out <a href="http://eepurl.com/iKKvRs">this short form</a>.

			Leon is approximately 1.43 years old. <a href="img/leon/74_hello.gif">Greetings!</a>
		<br>
		<br>
			As of this week, he is pretty well down to one nap, so now we get up to six consecutive hours of Leon time. <a href="img/leon/74_pool.png">Oh boy!</a>
		<br>
		<br>
			And, through constant quizzing about a folding map that our nanny Junko procured from a station attendant and we taped to the kitchen table wall, he has greatly improved our knowledge of all of the subway lines!
		<br>
		<br>
			Finally, I hope you have managed to get through this post without thinking about blueberries. From recent experience, if anyone in Leon's vicinity turns any aspect of their attention to blueberries, he will somehow intuit it and start implacably asking for some. Thank you for not thinking about blueberries!

                <br>
                        He also spends enough time in the swings that the crook of his elbow is noticeably paler than the rest of his arm!

                <br>
                        And he <a href="img/leon/70_wastrel.png">can't believe</a> how much food the girl near him is spilling on the ground!

                <br>
                        More controversially, he has developed a habit of walking to the hall closet, pointing inside, and instructing me to get the broom out and sweep the floor.

                        Last week Leon took his first plane ride. <a href="img/leon/64_plane.png">He did well</a>!
                <br>
                <br>
                        That plane landed in Minneapolis, where he met several hundred well-wishers (see third photo above for one of them).
                <br>
                <br>
                        Some days later, Leon took his second plane ride. <a href="img/leon/64_plane_2.png">It was also good</a>!
                <br>
                <br>
                        That plane landed in New York, where Leon currently keeps a pied-Ã -terre.

                <br>
                        When not on a slide, he may also be found chasing pigeons, pushing carts around our building's laundry room, opening and closing playground gates, and developing increasingly strong opinions on the proper course of his daily life!
