			Leon is approximately 1.12 years old and blows kisses to all kinds of people! <font size=3>boh!</font>
		<br>
		<br>
			He also regularly charms nearby passengers on the subway! <font size=3>neeh!</font>	
		<br>
		<br>
			And he now enjoys picking a random word from whatever you just said and, sort of, repeating it! <font size=3>pih!</font>
		<br>
		<br>
			Finally, I am just out of frame of the following video, but all you need to know is that we have a hand crank radio that I start cranking about 5 seconds in, and Leon has an  <a href="leon_58_movie.html">opinion</a> about that (9-second video with sound). <font size=3>opp!</font>

                        Leon is approximately 1.08 years old and can use a spoon, depending on mood, time of day, and your precise personal definition of "use".
                <br>
                <br>
                        He also greatly enjoys (someone else) counting on fingers!
                <br>
                <br>
                        And, after a solid year of chaos, Leon has entered his putting-things-in-containers phase! Look out, entropy!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, here is a <a href="leon_56_movie.html">video</a> that I accidentally but fortuitously shot in slo-mo (4-second video, no sound).

                        Leon is approximately 1.04 years old and can make a <a href="img/leon/54_scary.png">scary face</a>!
                <br>
                <br>
                        His current favorite activities are opening and closing doors, identifying (some) nearby letters and numbers, and laughing at taller people's attempts to join him under the kitchen table!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, to the vague consternation of his parents, he has also begun to acquire the rudiments of bargaining! Here comes an education for us all!
