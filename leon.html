			Leon is 1.96 years old and has gotten into <a href="img/leon/102_lean.png">leaning</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
			He also helped me have a <a href="img/leon/102_birthday.png">nice birthday</a>. (This photo was taken shortly after I sang <a href="https://kcls.org/content/ants-go-marching/">Ants Go Marching</a> up to about 40 to keep him from running around the restaurant.)
		<br>
		<br>
			And the other day he awoke from his afternoon nap, sat up, and said "We've never taken the Q66 bus."
		<br>
		<br>
			One more anecdote: I recently told Leon something might happen "if we're lucky". Then I asked him if he knows what "lucky" means. He paused reflectively, then said "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souvlaki">souvlaki</a>". Correct!

                        Last week a winter illness made its way through our house. It left Leon quiet and <a href="img/leon/98_ill.png">contemplative</a>, though <a href="img/leon/98_letters.png">not for very long</a>.

                        Leon is 1.85 years old and, as of his second visit this morning, has gotten slightly better at going to the dentist!
                <br>
                <br>
                        And he can walk to our mailbox, select the appropriate key from a keyring, open the lock, open the door, retrieve the mail, and close and lock the door, thus committing felony mail theft!
                <br>
                <br>
                        He can also open the kitchen sink cabinet, take out the recycling bin, open the front door, carry the bin down the hall to the recycling room, open that door, have one of his increasingly useless parents sort its contents into the appropriate bins, and then return everything to its proper place!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Good luck getting him to sit on a toilet, though!

                <br>
                        And he (probably) just set our local post office's all-time <a href="img/leon/88_usps.png">customer satisfaction</a> record!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, the other day Leon was getting boisterous near the end of dinner, so we decided to distract him with spelling. "S-P-O-O-N," I said. "M-E-A-T-S-A-U-C-E," said his mother. "P-O-O-P," said Leon (despite not actually having any idea what spelling is -- he just happened to draw those letters out of his mental bag).

                <br>
                        He can also (sort of) recount past events!

                <br>
                        Finally, yesterday, after throwing a piece of chalk into the water off the pier, he watched it sink beneath the waves, and then turned to me and asked me to "OPEN" the East River. I would if I could, Leon!

                <br>
                <br>
                        Also, last  weekend we took a crowded bus back from the day's second playground session, and as Leon stared ruminatively out the window, Marcella and I chatted idly. The discussion turned to costumes, and from costumes to Halloween, at which point Leon turned from the window to us, said "boo", and, having done what he must, returned to the window's silence.
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, if that last anecdote has left you with the impression that Leon is merely a whimsical and happy-go-lucky little imp, please consult this <a href="img/leon/78_greetings.png">intimidating photo</a> for contrary evidence.

                <br>
                        As of this week, he is pretty well down to one nap, so now we get up to six consecutive hours of Leon time. <a href="img/leon/74_pool.png">Oh boy!</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                        And, through constant quizzing about a folding map that our nanny Junko procured from a station attendant and we taped to the kitchen table wall, he has greatly improved our knowledge of all of the subway lines!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, I hope you have managed to get through this post without thinking about blueberries. From recent experience, if anyone in Leon's vicinity turns any aspect of their attention to blueberries, he will somehow intuit it and start implacably asking for some. Thank you for not thinking about blueberries!
