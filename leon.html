		<h4>April 25, 2025</h4>
		<p>
			Leon is approximately 1.19 years old and can go down all of the public slides in a one-mile radius!
		<br>
		<br>
			When not mid-slide, he may also be found chasing pigeons, pushing carts around our building's laundry room, opening and closing playground gates, and developing increasingly strong opinions on the proper course of his daily life!

                <br>
                        Leon is approximately 1.15 years old and walking all over the place!
                <br>
                <br>
                        He also enjoys eating many kinds of fish!
                <br>
                <br>
                        And if you need a <1 lb object transported haltingly across a short distance, we know just the guy!

                        Finally, here are 19 seconds of Leon <a href="leon_60_movie.html">attending to his affairs</a> (video with ambient sound).

                        Leon is approximately 1.12 years old and blows kisses to all kinds of people! <font size=3>boh!</font>
                <br>
                <br>
                        He also regularly charms nearby passengers on the subway! <font size=3>neeh!</font>
                <br>
                <br>
                        And he now enjoys picking a random word from whatever you just said and, sort of, repeating it! <font size=3>pih!</font>
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, I am just out of frame of the following video, but all you need to know is that we have a hand crank radio that I start cranking about 5 seconds in, and Leon has an  <a href="leon_58_movie.html">opinion</a> about that (9-second video with sound). <font size=3>opp!</font>

                <br>
                        Leon is approximately 1.08 years old and can use a spoon, depending on mood, time of day, and your precise personal definition of "use".
                <br>
                <br>
                        He also greatly enjoys (someone else) counting on fingers!
                <br>
                <br>
                        And, after a solid year of chaos, Leon has entered his putting-things-in-containers phase! Look out, entropy!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, here is a <a href="leon_56_movie.html">video</a> that I accidentally but fortuitously shot in slo-mo (4-second video, no sound).

                <br>
                        Leon is approximately 1.04 years old and can make a <a href="img/leon/54_scary.png">scary face</a>!
                <br>
                <br>
                        His current favorite activities are opening and closing doors, identifying (some) nearby letters and numbers, and laughing at taller people's attempts to join him under the kitchen table!
                <br>
                <br>
                        Finally, to the vague consternation of his parents, he has also begun to acquire the rudiments of bargaining! Here comes an education for us all!
