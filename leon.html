		Leon is a month old! He now weighs slightly more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_eagle">bald eagle</a>. One time we got him to calm down by singing The Star-Spangled Banner, so he's as patriotic as a bald eagle, too.
		<br>
		<br>
		Marcella's parents are now back in Minnesota. That means we've had a few days as a trio. Things are getting figured out, and then changing, and then getting figured out again. A consequence of fractured sleep is the sense of one endless day, but the day is so different from the ones before that we can't really be mad about it.
		<br>
		<br>
 		Some milestones: first bath (with poured water); first pie (visual inspection only); now frequently grabs the shirt of whoever is holding him (with somewhat disturbing strength, the effect of which is often compounded by continuous and dispassionate eye contact).
		</p>

		<h4>March 8, 2024</h4>
		Leon is now three weeks old! There's no pediatrician visit for this milestone. However,  we did buy what the internet claims is an accurate scale, so we can report that according to the <a href="https://opentraits.org/datasets/avonet.html">AVONET database of birds</a>, Leon probably weighs a bit more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_adjutant">lesser adjutant</a> and a bit less than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy_eagle">harpy eagle</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Things continue to be pretty good. Leon has gotten better, maybe too much better, at being awake, so we've upped the number of contact naps and discovered that the emergency radio Marcella received from a WQXR pledge drive, when tuned to an empty band, produces quality white noise.
		<br>
		<br>
		Marcella's parents head back to Minnesota next week, so the two of us took advantage of the presence of babysitters with a genetic investment in Leon's well-being and had dinner at <a href="https://fulgurances.com/en/the-restaurants/fulgurances-laundromat/">our favorite special occasion restaurant</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Leon also had his first stroller walk this week. Seeing Leon in the context of the world, and not the context of our home, is strange, but probably inevitable, given how children work.
		</p>

		<h4>March 1, 2024</h4>
		<p>
		Today was Leon's two-week pediatrician appointment. He continues to be, medically speaking, a big ol' baby. The half-mile round trip was our first walk as a family (baby wraps are cool; I'm wearing Leon right now).
		<br>
		<br>
Leon is an enthusiastic participant in all of the human bodily functions. He sometimes reminds us of somebody who, having been placed in the cockpit of an airplane for the first time, decides to press every single button at once.
		<br>
		<br>
		Matthew's parents visited this week. Having them here has been fun. Finding place for six adults and one baby in a 600 square foot apartment has been fun, too. Last night the grandparents kicked us out, so the two of us had a surprisingly relaxed dinner at the restaurant across the street.
		<br>
		<br>
		We're slowly becoming less and less anxious as Leon patiently presents us with evidence that he's not as fragile as we think. We're also averaging 6-7 hours of sleep per 24 hours, though frankly, I hesitate to even write this fact down, since given what people had told us about newborns, that number seems like a random and unearned gift.
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally, here is a (somewhat old) 9-second video of Leon <a href="leon_2_movie.html">making noises in his sleep</a>.

		<h4>February 25, 2024</h4>
		<p>
		Leon is now over a week old!  He has regained most of his birth weight and is feeding well. Marcella’s parents are nearby for a few weeks, and their help — especially the evening period when they take Leon into the living room and we put on earplugs and eye masks and make a deposit in the sleep bank — is appreciated. 
		<br>
		<br>
		So far, life feels kind of like it’s shrunk to a space about the size of our apartment. Sometimes that space just seems to be feeding and diapering and figuring out who is less dangerously close to falling asleep. But sometimes we’re staring at Leon and don’t know why we’d bother doing anything else. Overall, pretty good!
