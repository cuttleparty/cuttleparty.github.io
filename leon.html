		Today was Leon's two-week pediatrician appointment. He continues to be, medically speaking, a big ol' baby. The half-mile round trip was our first walk as a family (baby wraps are cool; I'm wearing Leon right now).
		<br>
		<br>
Leon is an enthusiastic participant in all of the human bodily functions. He sometimes reminds us of somebody who, having been placed in the cockpit of an airplane for the first time, decides to press every single button at once.
		<br>
		<br>
		Matthew's parents visited this week. Having them here has been fun. Finding place for six adults and one baby in a 600 square foot apartment has been fun, too. Last night the grandparents kicked us out, so the two of us had a surprisingly relaxed dinner at the restaurant across the street.
		<br>
		<br>
		We're slowly becoming less and less anxious as Leon patiently presents us with evidence that he's not as fragile as we think. We're also averaging 6-7 hours of sleep per 24 hours, though frankly, I hesitate to even write this fact down, since given what people had told us about newborns, that number seems like a random and unearned gift.
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally, here is a (somewhat old) 9-second video of Leon <a href="leon_2_movie.html">making noises in his sleep</a>.

		<h4>February 25, 2024</h4>
		<p>
		Leon is now over a week old!  He has regained most of his birth weight and is feeding well. Marcella’s parents are nearby for a few weeks, and their help — especially the evening period when they take Leon into the living room and we put on earplugs and eye masks and make a deposit in the sleep bank — is appreciated. 
		<br>
		<br>
		So far, life feels kind of like it’s shrunk to a space about the size of our apartment. Sometimes that space just seems to be feeding and diapering and figuring out who is less dangerously close to falling asleep. But sometimes we’re staring at Leon and don’t know why we’d bother doing anything else. Overall, pretty good!
