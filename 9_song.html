	Chorus:
	<br>
	This hand is your hand, this hand is my hand
	<br>
	It’s your own body, you’ll come to understand
	<br>
	From the five phalanges, down to the lunate
	<br>
	This hand was made for you and me
	<br>

	<br>
	Verse 1:
	<br>
	When you start playing, you waggle and wiggle
	<br>
	And you flex your biceps and your arms jiggle
	<br>
	I hold your hands and it makes you giggle
	<br>
	These hands are yours, can't you see?
	<br>
	
	<br>
	Chorus
	<br>
	
	<br>
	Verse 2:
	<br>
	You hold your arm out and now something bumps you
	<br>
	You brush your eyebrows and you feel your cheeks too
	<br>
	Slowly learning, what’s a part of you
	<br>
	These two hands are yours, through and through
	<br>
	
	<br>
	Chorus
	<br>
	
	<br>
	Verse 3:
	<br>
	Now as you grow and learn, you're starting to crawl
	<br>
	You reach and grasp for things, you stand up tall
	<br>
	With body schema, you have a ball
	<br>
	'Cause these hands are yours, after all
	<br>
	
	<br>
	Chorus
	<br>
	
	<br>
	Outro:
	<br>
	Yes, this hand was made for you and me
